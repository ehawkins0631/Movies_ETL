Extract, Transform, Load


Purpose:


* Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
* Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
* Clean and transform data using Pandas.
* Use regular expressions (Regex) to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
* Load data with PostgreSQL and verify in PgAdmin.


The project included extracting a large data set from Kaggle, then transforming the data into a usable dataset for a "hacking competition." Once the data was transformed and narrowed in scope for the hackathon, the DataFrames were loaded into PostgresSQL.
